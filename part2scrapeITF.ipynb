    "### My Project - Moneyball for College Tennis:\n",
    "- I initiallly intended on producing a system to identify promising junior tennis players whose rankings do not reflect their upside potential... with the thought that this could be a powerful recruiting tool for college coaches.\n",
    "- Currently, the junior rankings are based on the best six singles results plus 25% of the best six doubles results over the trailing 52-weeks (rankings are updated weekly).  Players are assigned points based on the tournament level (GA, G1, G2, G3, G4, G5) and how deep they go in a tournament (quarter finals, semi finals, finals, winner).\n",
    "- No consideration is given for quality wins, bad losses or close losses against players whose rankings are significantly higher.  Additionally, adding a weight for doubles results is non-sensicle for a singles ranking (it was done to encourage players to enter both singles and doubles events).  Furthermore, it's expensive for players to travel and play the tournaments that offer the most ranking points (ie: highest levels).\n",
    "- This creates a disadvantage for players who don't have the (financial) means to travel all over the world.\n",
    "- My plan was to scrape all the junior and college results, add ranking features and build a predictive model to identify attributes of players with more upside than other players with similar rankings.  A weighted logistic regression model was one approach to identify/classify players who are \"undervalued\".  I care more about the accuracy of predicting players with upside than the opportunity costs of missing players with upside.\n",
    "\n",
    "- I scraped all results for every single division I college tennis player since 2012 (prior to 2012, the website with the data was inconsistent).\n",
    "- I then scraped all results for the top 500 ranked junior tennis players in the world.  This turned out to be quite clallenging as the ITF website has blocks on requests coming from non-java clients (ie: scripts).  Additionally, I needed to interact with the website (ie: click buttons, etc).\n",
    "- I used Selenium, an open-source web-based automation tool that allows you to makes calls to (and run operations on) a browser.  This solution addressed both my problems.\n",
    "- I was ultimately able to scrape all historical results for all current players ranked in the top 500.  However, the website does not provide point-in-time rankings.  In other words, I had no way to get the rankings of players at the time they played their matches.  I would have to calculate those rankings myself.  This entails scraping players who are no longer ranked (because they aged out of juniors)... and that data is in another format.  I made the strategic decision at this point, to put my project on hold and perform data analysis on what I have scraped... with the full intention of finishing my ultimate project at a later date.\n",
    "- the data analysis I perform includes: adding features mentioned above, assigning a value to those features and then identifying current players whose rankings appear to be understated.\n",
    "\n",
    "bonus points features:\n",
    "- number of sets (3 means close)\n",
    "- games won\n",
    "- games lost\n",
    "- Outcome (if score has letter in it, then no contest for bonus points)\n",
    "- qualityWin (ranking difference for wins over higher ranked players)\n",
    "- qualityLoss (ranking difference for three-set losses over higher ranked players)\n",
    "- badLoss (ranking difference for losses over lower ranked players)\n",
    "- number of matches played (excludes withdraws and defaults)\n",
    "- win pct\n",
    "- alpha:  (sum of qualityWin + 50% x qualityLoss) / ranking\n",
    "\n",
    "findings:\n",
    "- of the top 500 ranked junior tennis players, I've identified 26 junior players whose rankings meaningfully understate the quality of their wins and losses (alpha of at least 2.0).\n",
    "- there are an additional 31 players whose rankings also understate the quality of their wins and losses, though not as extreme.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next Steps:\n",
    "- scrape year-end junior rankings for 2013-2017.\n",
    "- from the year-end junior rankings, identify players whose results have not been scraped... and scrape them.\n",
    "- now we have all players results historically... and we can recreate point-in-time rankings every week.\n",
    "- we can then assign opponent point-in-time rankings at the time matches were played.\n",
    "- now we can backtest and see if players with excess alpha actually perform better in college than comparitvely ranked players who had lower alpha.\n",
    "- scrape professional results (most juniors in the top 500 play some professional tournaments and some have unusually good success).\n",
    "\n",
